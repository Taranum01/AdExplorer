# AdExplorer

This project is a python-based ad-finder tool that takes a URL as an input and returns a list of relevant ads based on common words present on the page. 

The tool uses the Beautiful Soup library to extract the text from the URL and the RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction) library to identify important keywords and phrases.
